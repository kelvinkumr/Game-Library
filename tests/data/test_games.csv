The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system.

231330,Deadfall Adventures,"Nov 15, 2013",19.99,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R.

A group of amateur paranormal investigators have been assigned to the home in a hope to lay to rest these claims and help prompt the homes eventual sell. It's been a week since then. After a long day of police work, you begin your drive home. Of course, unexpectedly you are driven off the road, barely surviving a huge fall.

Generally it manifested itself as recovery of motion functions and need for food. But in some cases scientsits found out that the creatures had totally independent behavior and strong desire to control and destroy all species around for their personal purposes. As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds. It was enough for the young bioweapon to feel free and escape. In this game you will act like the young bioweapon. You will encounter lots of traps and puzzles. You will have to possess human bodies to pass the game to the end. Good luck!

Speed through a world over 400km² in size , from the depths of the Forest, to the plains of the Grassland, out to the heat of the Desert, and the cold of the Snow. You need to earn new cars. The longer you survive and the more vehicles you destroy, the further you'll stray from sanity... but, you'll unlock newer, faster and stronger vehicles in the process. Listen to 3 extensive radio stations, and add your favorite music with custom radio stations. Download and upload custom vehicles and radio stations using the Steam Workshop. Although it's The Pointless Car Chase, that doesn't mean you can't have points ; that'd be unreasonable. With Steam Cloud integration, keep all your saved progress no matter which device you're on.

As such, Minds Eyes uses many elements that should not normally be combined in a proper horror game. None the less, through all of your feedback, videos and discussions, I was able to transform all of the successes and failures into my subsequent titles: A Girls Fabric Face and Suit 776. To that, I thank you all! :)) Minds Eyes brings you to a world of dreams. You wake up from your slumber to constantly discover you are still asleep. You venture throughout your own home as well as some pieces of your imagination to discover who or what is keeping you at sleep. Will you ever wake up? will you ever finish the journey? Venture through tense full moments of a chilling and nerve wrecking atmosphere that will keep you wondering 'When will something happen!'. Interact with the game and collect game objects which will overall affect your score in the end. Can you locate all game items?, can you make it without a single death? Check what the mind has in store. NOTE: This game is to be played with a single sitting. The estimated game time is 30-45min. This game also includes flashing lights. If flashing lights affect any of your medical conditions, please avoid the game. **SO! what is Minds Eyes really? think of it as an experiment. I have developed Minds Eyes to experiment with new mechanics, features, animations, interactions, and more. Ultimately, I am using this game to gather information in order to build my ultimate horror experience. Think of it as research and development!. I will be watching a large portion of videos that you all send out to me, and note what was good and bad. With that said, If possible, please give me a full on review of the game.

1870170,Emiko's Pledge,"Feb 25, 2022",0.99,"Emiko's Pledge is a 2D Platform Action game based on the story of a Half Demon girl called Emiko, whose mission is to fulfill her dream of becoming the best warrior in the Demon world and also, to protect the Ettaze state from the enemies who infiltrated into the territory. There has been a long term conflict between the Ettaze and Trettaze states since the time when the Ettaze ruler decided to accept the fact that the human beings had the rights to co-exist with the demons in the Ettaze state where the majority of the state were the demons. This was the kind gesture of the ruler who gave the human beings the equal opportunities to join the universities and have a working career in the state even when some demons had a notion of looking down upon the humans. Under the leadership of Gabbon, the Ettaze ruler, the humans and demons learned to co-exist with each other which the ruler of Trettaze state could never accept. The ruler of the Trettaze state started to attack them in every possible way, banning imports and exports, barring tourists from the state to enter the territory etc. This had led to a war breaking out between the two states. However, Trettaze was the first one to officially declare the war against the Ettaze and threatened to kill all of the humans and the demons of the state. The ruler of the Ettaze had a hunch that a war between the states would break out anytime. He hired the best warriors of the state, the team of the three Demon Girls called Tri-Demon Girls who were said to be the strongest team of warriors in the state, in order to eliminate the intruders at all costs. Meanwhile, Emiko, the granddaughter of the Ettaze ruler, decided to step in at her own will and helped out the Tri-Demon girls team in her own way in order to protect the state against the intruders. Even as a half-demon she had a strong will and determination to achieve something big. Emiko with her own 'Devil Weapon' begins her journey to defeat the enemies, and to become the best warrior in the state and abroad. You play as Emiko and your mission is to fight against the enemies in order to protect the weak. Key Features: 15 Levels to play! Different kinds of enemies including three-headed monster! Lots of deadly traps and obstacles to overcome! 3 Firing modes which include regular, laser and Plasma modes. Ability to freeze the enemies and double jump! Story Driven! Difficult situations and hard to master! Note: I am a solo indie game developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, programming, designing except for the music.

471770,"In Case of Emergency, Release Raptor","Aug 29, 2016",0,"NOTE: This game is very unfinished and is free for you to enjoy because we thought what is there was fun and worth you being able to tinker with. We make no claim that this is a complete experience. It was a passion project for Chris, and a lot of time was poured into this, and we wanted to let you faff about with it. If you leave a review, then reviewing it based on what it actually is (a freebie tech demo) is appreciated. Be a raptor, feel like one, and smash robots to bits. Procedurally-assembled 3D environments set in a scenic futuristic dystopia. Free release of an aborted Early Access title. We hope you enjoy it! Note that this is an AS-IS release, based on popular demand, rather than us taking it down completely. Sell Me The Idea In One Sentence If I have to convince you why being any form of dromaeosaurid is freaking awesome, then I'm not sure we can be friends. This game is carefully crafted to give you the closest possible feeling of being one of these glorious monsters -- then turning you loose to do fun stuff. What’s The Point? 1. For the pure fun of the thing. In 1993, a certain game let you be a raptor. The controls were iffy. The levels were short and static. It's very dated. Yet many of us still dust it off periodically -- just to be a raptor. Release Raptor gives you a far more satisfying, modern, dynamic experience. 2. For a power trip. For speedrunning and finesse, you're on an invincible rampage. It's not about IF you can do it, but how WELL you do it. Your performance is evaluated, so mistakes still have consequences without interrupting the flow of the game. 3. To play with kids. I want to be able to play this with my 5 year old son, but still have dismemberment (because that's cool). How to do that without blood or gore? Robots! Little robots = pouncing targets; giant mechs = dismemberment targets. Procedural Assembly What on earth do we mean by 'procedurally-assembled?' Basically, we're using a very heavy mix of handcrafted content with procedural bits making it fresh each time. Creating unique and recognizable areas is a huge focus, because otherwise you get unimaginative 'procgen blandness.' Yuck! But we still wanted that sense of exploration, and so not chunk of level is present in every run, the layouts of the overall level (and where enemies are as well) varies quite a bit. NB: Yes, we know that’s not a velociraptor (and there should be feathers).",['English'],"“This is so cool.” AaronSayWhat “Being a raptor and doing raptor stuff, always a good time.” DemoStorm “I wish I could have finished making this, but instead you can have it for free.” Chris Park (Arcen dev)",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/header.jpg?t=1586552189,http://arcengames.com/in-case-of-emergency-release-raptor/,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,0,0,,"Arcen Games, LLC","Arcen Games, LLC","Single-player,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Indie,Adventure,Dinosaurs,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_8391ae4084299a3506e26f57d1a1799cf266e149.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_ce1be30904fae9a7f620104ae74b0bc95760d55b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_d9220b46791f15a140a0189c805ced44be399005.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_1fe3c05f43ccfe9dd4d663cdc5e4d7e8abeaa026.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_cd7a55537b646ee66caae00341b6ce4dc4854d52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_23ebb63f9f88fb712c8888c269b3c3e9d8956437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_c9e306100e143ac190a38b1a27283a9abedcb95e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_04a66bb7aabdd569b9c3b1888a67288eeb3f5d21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_e0930921ce3936bebc3dd75976823d8eba5a8551.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_584eb9bacbf4046a37eaeca8fd707d3ddcfa1f9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_ac5ad620d4e6842064cc6789ece5edc8f15f73bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_a16501e46e9163fba9bc65144bf9c97b15720f35.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_7280f45fb9b6d16b9645f29c4d9e1b455b128cdd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_12bff1b13b9dc4de77c8f3f6918a91b80cb6e7ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_87d1eaf76389a2f75f84e3f5ba222ebe38e65ca2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256669489/movie_max.mp4?t=1472063621,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665679/movie_max.mp4?t=1465952402,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256664108/movie_max.mp4?t=1463077343"

428410,PRiO,"Mar 18, 2016",5.99,"PRiO is a visually-striking, yet challenging platformer about manipulating the environment around you. To complete a stage, you must light up all the blocks in a level. The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death. Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours. This game is built around a simple concept of toggling the environment in order to navigate. In the beginning, it may seem easy enough to handle, but as the levels go by, you'll quickly realize the challenge that confronts you. Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. PRiO is currently only available on Windows. Please note: The game is completely functional using a keyboard and mouse, however it's highly recommended that you use a Gamepad to play PRiO.",['English'],"“sharp gameplay that’s right at the sweet-spot between too tough and too easy” Indie Game Magazine “PRiO is punishing, but in the best possible way” Alpha Beta Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/header.jpg?t=1478028084,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,9,0,,DanielDavisGames,DanielDavisGames,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Includes level editor","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Indie,Adventure,Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_79ccab4e49d954efce2fa70da483d7a52f29053a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_536bb4fdca229cc1a7ab65687341aa0052558b6a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_6da76fe06e8ea30723eb371b47a5e43ca38513dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_a5911b9a3df6318a5a5ae4dd5a583afea1f3861b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_2806fe65917768d21e8a4165c6f213c2f2c88437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_45518e5f667c5fb4d5a4efcbba69d3cb87b1248d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_972e56577c519056e1c54dc53db25d970e9e6b1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_add9cf6e0e090c946512879934b88d8ac02ca983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660686/movie_max.mp4?t=1456256086

Do this by solving problems and sneaking past some non-friendly dogs. Play as a cat! Have fun playing as a cat!

Reignite a bleak world, while unfolding its secrets in tales lost to the ashes. After countless years of restless war as a last ditch effort King Gawain turned to his Archmage to help him turn the tides of battle. The Archmage created a spell that was never used before and unleashed it onto the Kingdom. The battle ended, but everything changed. Fires started to burn blue, giving only cold instead of warmth, monsters arose from the ground, and soldiers lost their minds. Hundreds of years after the Last Battle, a lone Pyromancer awoke on the battlefield. What the Pyromancer had was unseen in years: a fire with heat. As the last pyromancer you'll have access to a lot of defensive and offensive spells, use them at your liking to overcome the difficulties of the land while trying to reginite the world. Anceps is a kingdom full of corrupted and mindless beasts. In a world such as this, use your wits, magic and agility to overcome the greatest difficulties of these lands. Can you unravel what happened hundreds of years ago, what turned this world upside down, when all you have to go on are rumors?
